# PleaseClap
A Command Line Interface, single file applet for clapping on Medium blogs.

This is a single file command line applet that will take your user data and clap 50 times on any Medium post you input. 

I originally had this code just have them enter their variables in a cloned copy of the code but decided to have fun and make it a CLI app.

It requires Ruby and three of Ruby's default gems: 'uri', 'net/http', 'json', and the user data requires you to make use of the Chrome Dev Tools.

For more details, check out the code's comments.
