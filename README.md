# PleaseClap
A CLI, single file applet for clapping for you on Medium blogs.

This is a single file command line applet that will take your user data and clap for you 50 times on any Medium posts you input. 

It was built so my students could support each other's blogs while seeing a demonstration of the power of the Chrome Network Tab.

I originally had this code just have them enter their variables in a cloned copy of the code but decided to have fun and make it a CLI app, because that's what the students are learning to build right now.

It requires Ruby and three of Ruby's default gems: 'uri', 'net/http', 'json', and the user data requires you to make use of the Chrome Dev Tools.

For more details, check out the code's comments.
